<!-- Since January 1st 2020, I am a _Professeur_ of Computing Science at [_Université du Québec a Montréal_](https://uqam.ca/) (UQAM), member of the [_Département d'Informatique_](https://info.uqam.ca/) and of the [_LATECE_](https://latece.uqam.ca). I'm interested in security, privacy and applied cryptography.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">HOT</span> I have several [open positions](positions) for students interested in those fields.

An important part of my research is concerned with exploiting the latest developments of homomorphic encryption in order to provide better _Privacy Enhancing Technologies_. For example, we developped the [_NFLLib_](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib) toolkit and [_XPIR_ Private Information Retrieval](https://github.com/XPIR-team/XPIR) on top of it.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">GDR</span> I was deputy director of the [Groupement de Recherche (GDR) Sécurité Informatique](https://gdr-securite.irisa.fr) which hosts all french researchers on Computer Security under a common virtual laboratory.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">Secondment</span> I am a _Directeur de Recherche_ [_CNRS_](https://cnrs.fr) on secondment. You can find my previous professional webpage [here](https://homepages.laas.fr/mkilliji). -->

Since January 1st, 2020, I have been a Professor of Computing Science at the [_Université du Québec a Montréal_](https://uqam.ca/) (UQAM), where I am a member of both the [_Département d'Informatique_](https://info.uqam.ca/) and of the [Laboratoire de recherche sur les technologies du commerce electronique  (LATECE)](https://latece.uqam.ca). My primary areas of interest lie in the fields of security, privacy, and applied cryptography.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">HOT</span>I am currently seeking motivated students who share a passion for these domains and are eager to join my research team. If you are interested in exploring cutting-edge security solutions, there are several [opportunities](positions) available.

A significant focus of my research involves leveraging recent advancements in homomorphic encryption to enhance _Privacy Enhancing Technologies_ (PETs). My team and I have developed the [_NFLLib_](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib) toolkit, a powerful resource designed to facilitate work in this area, as well as [_XPIR_ Private Information Retrieval](https://github.com/XPIR-team/XPIR), an implementation of Private Information Retrieval built on the foundation provided by NFLLib. Additionally, we have contributed to the development of [_RevoLUT_](https://github.com/sofianeazogagh/revoLUT), a Rust library that reimagines the use of Look-Up-Tables (LUT) beyond their conventional role in function encoding, as commonly used in TFHE’s programmable bootstrapping. Instead, RevoLUT leverages LUTs as direct data structures, enabling efficient operations such as sorting and elements permutation directly within the table. This approach supports oblivious algorithms, providing a secure, privacy-preserving solution for handling sensitive data in various applications. These projects exemplify our commitment to pushing the boundaries of privacy-centric cryptographic tools.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-primary">GDR</span> Previously, I served as the Deputy Director of the Groupement de Recherche (GDR) Securite Informatique, a collaborative network that unites French researchers specializing in computer security under a cohesive virtual laboratory. This role allowed me to contribute significantly to fostering research collaboration and innovation within the national community.

<span class="badge badge-pill badge-warning">Secondment</span> Additionally, I hold the position of Directeur de Recherche at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and am currently on secondment at UQAM. For those interested in my earlier work and career accomplishments, my previous professional webpage is available for reference.
