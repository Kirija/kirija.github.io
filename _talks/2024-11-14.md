In this talk, I presented the challenges faced when using a blackbox privacy enhancing technology, in particular regarding its asumptions. I illustrated the complexity of trusting the promises of confidentiality of the inputs, in particular when using a SMPC mechanism where the participants, or an eavesdropper, learn only the output of the mechanism. From the output of CryptoGraph, a mechanism for privately curating graph data, an adversary is able to reconstruct most of the input of the participants.
