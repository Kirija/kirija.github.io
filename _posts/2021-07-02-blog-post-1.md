Recently, I've been trying to help someone to install the [Meso-NH athmospheric model](http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/) on a new Macbook Air M1. In this post, I try to document how I partially suceeded.
In three words : up to now I have been able to compile it for x86_64 (on the arm64 based M1) and run it sucessfully using Rosetta2 on the M1, but I'm still stuck at the linkage/run part of a native arm64 version, I'll document that later.

Compiling Meso-NH for x86_64 emulation
======
The arm64 ecosystem is still in its infancy, not all compiler vendors, virtual machine managers, homebrew packets, have yet a version functionning   natively on Apple Silicon. Fortunately, the Apple Rosetta2 system, which emulates x86_64 on top of arm64, works pretty well. This is what we'll be using here to compile and run Meso-NH.

x86_64 and arm64 modes
------
In a nutshell, if you want to force the system to execute something in a mode, you can use the _arch_ command :

	arch -arm64 _your_command_to_be_executed_in_arm64_mode_
	arch -x86_64_ _your_command_to_be_executed_in_x86_64_mode_
	
Another interesting command I used intensively during my study was the _lipo_ command that you can use to check (and also create) architecture information of a binary file :

	lipo -info _your_exe_ 
	
This will tell you wether or not the binary is fat (contains multiple architecture executables) and for which architectures it is.	

Installing Homebrew for x86_64
------
At first, let's consider that you have a fresh M1 install and not yet installed homebrew on your machine. If you had, we'll discuss your case later, but keep reading this part.

In order to compile Meso-NH for x86_64, we need to get x86_64 version of _open-mpi_, _gcc_ and _git_ and for that, we are going to install a x86_64 homebrew.
That's going to be relatively simple if you have never installed homebrew on this machine (or didn't migrate an old homebrew from your previous Mac), otherwise i recommend some cleanup (if you need to, list the packages you had installed) :
	
	arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
	
and if that's needed, even a force clean

	sudo rm -fr /usr/local
	
Now we can go with the fresh install

	arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
	
And add homebrew binaries to your _path_ if it's not already the case :

	export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
	
That's it, you've got a fresh and clean install of a x86_64 homebrew installed and can start installing the compilation chain and dependancies, but to make sure that you'll be running that x86_64 version, you can check that :
	
	which brew
	
points to _/usr/local/bin/brew_
	
Installing x86_64 dependancies
------	
Installing _open_mpi_ will imply installing _gcc_, we also need _git_ :
	
	brew install git open-mpi
	
Now, we need to create symlinks to gcc and g++ (i don't know why but gfortran is already linked in gcc-11 and was not in gcc-5!) :

	cd /usr/local/bin
	rm gcc g++ 
	ln -s gcc-11 gcc
	ln -s g++-11 g++

A safety check that you're running gcc v11 :	
	gcc --version
	
Compiling x86_64 Meso-NH
------	
Now, you should be in a controlled territory and your usual Meso-NH compilation should work :

	cd src
	./configure
	source ../conf/_your_config_file_
	make -j12
	
What if you already had an arm64 homebrew ?
------	
Well, that's not too bad, you can easily deal with a dual homebrew and have packages installed for different, or both, architectures.

First you can optionnaly alias brew in order to easily choose which one you are dealing with :

	alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'
	alias abrew='arch -arm64 /opt/homebrew/bin/brew'
	
Then, I'd recommand launching a shell using the architecture you are going to use, and setup the paths according to the architecture you're running :

	arch -x86_64 zsh 
	arch -arm64 zsh 

And add those lines to your _.zshrc_ :

	if test "${architecture}" = "i386"; then
	    echo "Using Rosetta2 for x86 emulation"
		export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
	elif test "${whoa}" = "arm64"; then
	    echo "Benefitting from the Apple Silicon greatness"
		export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
	else
	    echo "Hello Houston ? We have a problem here."
	fi
