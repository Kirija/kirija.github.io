Recently, I've been trying to help someone to install the [Meso-NH athmospheric model](http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/) on a new Macbook Air M1. In this post, I try to document how I partially suceeded.
In three words : up to now I have been able to compile it for x86_64 (on the arm64 based M1) and run it sucessfully using Rosetta2 on the M1, but I'm still stuck at the linkage/run part of a native arm64 version.

Aren't headings cool?
